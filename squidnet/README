This directory contains the code to run squidnet. Squidnet requires
both clients and servers to function optimally.

The web client (that runs on tep.mit.edu) is spread across templates,
squidweb, public_html and sqldb.db. That leaves the squidnetlib directory.

The squidnetlib directory contains the module and other information order
to run squidnet servers. To install, read the README in there.
